# MoveShip Demo - Moving Shapes with SignalR

This repository is used as a sample application demonstrating how ASP.NET Core SignalR can be used to create interactive web apps. A space ship image is displayed in the browser. When clicked, the ship will follow the user's mouse. Once you click again, it stops moving. This way you don't have to hold the mouse the whole time.
